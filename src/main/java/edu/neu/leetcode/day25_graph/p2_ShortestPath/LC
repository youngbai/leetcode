- Algorithm
    - BFS
    - DFS
    - Dijkstra
    - Bellman-Ford
    - Floyd-Warshall
- Aspects of a Graph
    - directed vs undirected
    - weighted vs unweighted
    - cyclic vs acyclic
- Rule of Thumb for Solving Shortest Path Problems
    - BFS : unweighted graphs
    - Dijkstra : positive weighted graphs (An implied condition to apply the Dijkstra's algorithm is that the weights of the graph must be POSITIVE.)
    - Bellman Ford : negative weighted graphs

# Multiple Source Shortest Path
- Floyd-Warshall


# Pseudocode code:
Dijkstra:
    G
    distance[N] = {MAX}
    visited[N] = {false}
    pre[N]

    start from src
    distance[src]=0
    pre[src]=-1
    q.offer(src)

    while q is not empty
        int u = q.poll()
        visited[u]=true

        for (nei : G.get(u))
            if nei is not visited
                if distance[u] + G.get(u).get(nei) < distance[nei]
                    distance[nei] = distance[u] + G.get(u).get(nei)
                    pre[nei] = u
                    q.offer(nei)
